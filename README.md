# BeerMeBot
Code repository for the ongoing work of Tyler and Nate to achieve optimal laziness and drunkenness.

Arduino Coding Rules:
- Any constant name will be in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
- Variables use no_caps_with_underscoreOther variables and 
- Functions will use noSpaceCapSpeparation
- NEVER HAVE MAGIC NUMBERS!!! (Numbers included to "make something work")
- Use functions for any repeated operation
- Use if statements with Serial.print commands to be able to easily disable them
- Tabs not spaces
- Make the code writing as self-evident as possible (it should read like a sentence)
- Braces should be on the same line as the function

IERobot_2 for motor code
