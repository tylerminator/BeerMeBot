# BeerMeBot
Code repository for the ongoing work of Tyler and Nate to achieve optimal laziness and drunkenness.

Arduino Coding Rules:
1. Any constant name will be in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
2. Other variables and functions will use noSpaceCapSpeparation
3. NEVER HAVE MAGIC NUMBERS!!! (Numbers included to "make something work")
4. Use functions for any repeated operation
5. Use if statements with Serial.print commands to be able to easily disable them
6.
